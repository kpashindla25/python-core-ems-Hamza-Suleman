## Overview

- This repository contains three separate Python files. The reason for this was that I wanted to show case the different approaches I took when completing this task.

- The original file "Assessment.py" contains code to create an event management webapp system using just functions, this is a simple method but very effective.

- The second version "Assessment V2.py" contains code that serves the same purpose but has been written to be contained within a class, with the aim to employ OOP fundamentals.

- Finally, "Assessment V3.py" contains the same webapp, however this version aims to showcase the use of OOP more with the use of multiple classes and abstraction techniques.
