## Overview

- This repository contains three separate Python files. The reason for this was that I wanted to show case the different approaches I took when completing this task.

- The original file "Assessment.py" contains code to create an event management webapp system using just functions, this is a simple method but very effective.

- The second version "Assessment V2.py" contains code that serves the same purpose but has been written to be contained within a class, with the aim to employ OOP fundamentals.

- Finally, "Assessment V3.py" contains the same webapp, however this version aims to showcase the use of OOP more with the use of multiple classes and abstraction techniques.

## To do

- Add getters and setters for each private attribute (Complete)

- Add print-outs inside the exception class (Complete)

- Add more information for each attendee (Complete! - This was tough lol)

- Add a message to the user if they try to list events but there aren't any (Complete)
